## Addition

We can find the sum of two numbers by using the "+" symbol. For example, `15 + 20` should return 35.

---
## Code Example: Addition

```{r}
50 + 25
```
---
## Subtraction

To find the difference between two numbers, we can use the "-" symbol. For example, `60 - 20` should return 40.

---
## Code Example: Subtraction

```{r}
35 - 20
```
